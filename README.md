Proof of concept project for an idea to help limit the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

A user would have their doctor upload their info to the database. The user would then recieve an email with their login information. The phone app would display a QR code to allow other users to scan. The scan would only show a green light for all clear or possibly matching, or a yellow for cation or expired check up.
